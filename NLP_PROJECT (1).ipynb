It all changed this week when his first interview post the split appeared in GQ.  Pitt had been accused of beating his 15-year-old son Maddox on a plane in September, which prompted Jolie to file for divorce. The FBI and Child Services investigated him for child abuse. He was romantically linked to his Allied co-star Marion Cotillard, which she immediately denied.  The GQ spread, apart from the interview, includes a massive 8-day photoshoot of Pitt, 53, \\u201ctumbling through\\u201d three national parks, and a music video.  But according to the BBC, it was all a planned move by Pitt to correct his faltering image. In the interview, the actor admitted to having an alcohol problem, and how it might have caused the problems in his life. He said he is undergoing therapy and is on a road to recovery after coming to terms with the \\u201cself-inflicted\\u201d situation he\\u2019s in.  But instead of being called out for his behaviour, which, by his own admission is the reason his family was jarringly \\u201cripped apart\\u201d the Internet has sided with him.  An article titled \\u201cWhy Brad Pitt won the Jolie-Pitt war by throwing himself on his sword\\u201d published on E! said, \\u201cThrowing caution to the wind - and simultaneously capitalizing on 30 years of goodwill built up in Hollywood - Brad went for it, translating what he\\u2019s gleaned from his newfound love of therapy into a painfully self-aware, self-deprecating, oft-poetic and at times rambling discourse on a charmed life that veered off course and what he\\u2019s doing to right the ship.\\u201d  Vanity Fair said, \\u201cPitt clearly studied the lay-it-all-bare, heart-on-my-sleeve, owning-my-flaws interview section of the post-celebrity-divorce playbook. Learning from his tumultuous year is a theme of the talk, especially regarding the divorce, which is still under way. He comes across candid, remorseful, and keen to let the world know that he\\u2019s doing a lot of work on himself.\\u201d  And Huffington Post completes the trifecta of acceptance: \\u201cPeople like (Brad) do so much to give a face to the addiction crisis that claims so many lives. Thank you for your honesty, your courage, and your willingness to open up about your recovery.\\u201d  The BBC quotes PR guru Mark Borkowski as saying that Pitt would have \\u201cTotal copy approval, total picture approval, total headline approval,\\u201d on the interview.  \\u201cBut of course the timing is calculated,\\u201d Borkowski continues. \\u201cThe language is calculated. Everything is calculated. And everything is a gamble.\\u201d  \\u201cA lot of people prefer to stay before the waterline and not do it. He\\u2019s taken a massive risk and I can think of many who just wouldn\\u2019t go this far.\\u201d  Follow @htshowbiz for more  First Published: May 05, 2017 10:06 IST\",\n          \"With the sudden departure of Bebe Neuwirth\\u2019s Nadine Tolliver, there is an opening at the State Department on CBS\\u2019 Madam Secretary.

The estranged couple said in a joint statement to the The Associated Press on Feb. 15, 2018, \\\"Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly.

He was just 14 when his older brother Richie died on Nov. 13, 1990. And, as Shelton noted in a tweet Monday, \"It changed my life forever.\"  Richie was 24 when he died in a car accident in the Sheltons\\' home state of Oklahoma. Two years ago, Shelton sent out a message for the 25th anniversary of his loss:  Richie, who was Blake\\'s half-brother (they shared a mother), was a passenger in a car that collided with a school bus in Ada, south of Oklahoma City.  Richie, driver Redena McManus and a 3-year-old boy, Christopher McManus, all died during or shortly after the collision, while the bus driver and passengers were uninjured, according to police reports.  The accident has clearly remained with Blake, who told 60 Minutes in 2014, \"I remember picking up the phone to call him a week after he was dead, to tell him something. I was picking up the phone to call him, to tell him something I just saw on TV or, and it was like constantly a shock to me that he was dead.\"  Blake Shelton playing at TODAY\\'s Halloween Extravaganza in New York City on Oct. 31. Getty Images  In 2011, Blake and his then-wife Miranda Lambert wrote a single called \"Over You,\" which was inspired by Richie.  Still, the two brothers had bonded despite the age difference; both shared a love of country music. \"His bedroom was right across the hallway from mine when I was little,\" Blake said in that interview. \"And he was listening to Hank Williams, Jr. or Waylon, Lynyrd Skynyrd or Bob Seeger. I just, whatever was popular really, Richie loved all music.  \"And I would be sitting there going, \\'Man, that guy\\'s my hero. That\\'s the coolest guy.

Production on the sixth season had already begun prior to this all.    In another statement yesterday about the Spacey allegations, the two companies said, \"Media Rights Capital and Netflix are deeply troubled by last night’s news concerning Kevin Spacey.\"    House of Cards, considered to be one of the biggest moments in the careers of Spacey and Robin Wright (also increased the visibility of Mahershala Ali in mainstream entertainment) was Netflix\\'s first major original series production, setting the stage for what we know now to be the game-changing streaming giant.    Hollywood has seen a \"floodgate\" of accusations, with victims coming forward speaking about their stories after the Harvey Weinstein debacle.',\n","       'A jury ruled against Bill Cosby in his sexual assault retrial on Thursday, finding him guilty for aggravated indecent assault in all three counts brought against him by Andrea Constand. The entertainer now faces the possibility of spending the rest of his life in prison.  While Cosby showed no visible reaction to the verdict, he did react loudly when District Attorney Kevin Steele called for the entertainer’s bail to be revoked, saying that Cosby had his own plane and could flee.  “He doesn’t have his own plane, you a–hole,” the man once known as “America’s Dad” shouted, provoking gasps in the hushed courtroom.  O”Neill admonished the entertainer, but did not revoke bail.  Cosby, now 80, was found guilty of all three counts of aggravated indecent assault. Each count carries a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison. Sentencing is expected later this year -– and it could be a forum for some of the more than 50 other women who have said they were sexually assaulted by Cosby.  Cosby was charged with drugging and molesting Andrea Constand, who was operations manager of the women’s basketball team at Temple University, at his home outside Philadelphia back in January 2004. Cosby contended the sexual contact was consensual.  Related Gretchen Carlson on How Her Roger Ailes Lawsuit Affected the Cosby Case Kevin Spacey Faces Felony Sexual Assault Charge, Posts Bizarre Video  The jury’s announcement – delivered in a hushed courtroom at 1:45 p.m. – marked the stunning end to the first celebrity trial in the heated atmosphere of the #MeToo movement. The panel of seven men and five women, including two African-Americans, began deliberating on the case on Wednesday morning, and announced the verdict on the 14th day of the retrial.  At a news conference later, Steele said that Constand, by coming forward with her accusation, was a “major factor” in the #MeToo movement, and he said he hoped the verdict would help embolden other victims of sexual assault.  “We hope this case sends a strong message that victims of these types of crimes can come forward and be heard,” said Steele as Constand stood quietly a few feet away.  Steele said Cosby was potentially “facing years in prison,” but he declined to say what type of sentence he would seek. He suggested that he would seek a substantial fine, noting that Cosby’s legal team had described the civil settlement of nearly $3.4 million that Cosby had paid in a lawsuit brought by Constand as a “paltry sum.”  Cosby has been accused of sexual assault by dozens of women in the past few years, but Constand’s allegations are the only ones that became the subject of a criminal case. The charges against Cosby were filed on Dec. 30, 2015 – just days before the 12-year statute of limitations was due to expire.  The trial drew a number of the other Cosby accusers to the courthouse, and one of them broke down in tears and left the courtroom when the jury forewoman disclosed the guilty verdict.  The charges were first brought to trial last June, but the jury ended in a deadlock on all charges after more than 50 hours of deliberations.  The 80-year-old entertainer was accused by Constand, the former operations manager of the women’s basketball team at Temple University, of drugging and molesting her in January 2004. Constand said she became close with Cosby, who was a major supporter of the university, and viewed him as a mentor. She alleged that he abused her trust, however, when he invited her to his home in Montgomery County and offered her three blue pills to help her relax.  She testified that she took the pills because she trusted Cosby and believed they were some kind of an herbal relaxant, and soon became incapacitated. Then, she said, she felt his fingers inside of her, but “couldn’t fight him off.”  Late Wednesday, jurors asked for a re-reading of Cosby’s deposition in the civil lawsuit brought against him by Constand, who received a settlement of nearly $3.4 million.  In the deposition, Cosby describes the moves he put on Constand on the night in question. Cosby also acknowledged that many years before, he used to give quaaludes to women he wanted to have sex with.  Cosby left the courtroom without comment, and his defense team had nothing to say on the way out of court. His lead defense attorney, Thomas Mesereau, had successfully defended Michael Jackson against child molestation charges in 2005. The team had mounted a strong defense on behalf of the entertainer.  The once-revered entertainer is the only major celebrity to face a jury amid the growing cultural awareness of the problem of sexual assault. In less than a year, dozens of rich and powerful men have been accused of sexual harassment or assault as more women have decided to publicly address the issue.  While Constand had no public reaction to the verdict, her lawyer, Dolores Troiani, thanked the team of law-enforcement officers and prosecutors for taking on such a powerful man. She said that Constand had first filed the complaint against Cosby 14 years ago – and that it had taken all that time for her to obtain justice.  “Although justice was delayed, it was not denied,” said Troiani.  She said it has taken Constand a long time to deal with what had happened to her. “That’s something that she had to work out every day” since January 2004, said Troiani. “This is a life-altering experience for any victim.”  Lawyer Gloria Allred, who represents a number of the women who say Cosby sexually assaulted them, said the verdict was a victory for the victims. “After all is said and done, women were finally believed,” said Allred.  Following the guilty verdict, network Bounce TV announced that it was pulling all reruns of “The Cosby Show” from its schedule.
